# Ploty-Deployment

In this challenge, we completed the belly button dashboard and deploy a working version to GitHub Pages. In the module, we partially completed dashboard (i.e. individual demographic information panel), but now we need to finish it. We completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, the volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. This will enable them to identify a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef (Improbable Beef),the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in quantity in their navel.

# Bar Chart
The objectives of this challenge are to create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel, use JavaScript to select only the most populous species, create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel. To complete this task, when an individual’s ID is selected, the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) appear on the visualized bar chart. We created a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

# Bubble Chart 
We created a bubble chart that appears when the dashboard is first opened in a browser, ID 940’s data should be displayed in the dashboard. Once the user navigates to the dashboard, the user will be able to select from the dropdown and all of the info panel will appear. 

# Gauge Chart
Lastly, we created the gauge chart from to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual. We modify the example gauge code used in the documentation for values ranging from 0 through 9.
